[![npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/inline-outline.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inline-outline)

Create and edit a document outline using a web component.

## Install

The project is distributed as an [`IIFE`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/IIFE), so the easiest way is to just create a script tag pointing to the export hosted on [unpkg](https://unpkg.com/).

```html
<script src="unpkg.com/inline-outline" defer></script>
```

However, you can also install the package and add the script through some build process.

```html
<script src="dist/inline-outline.iife.js" defer></script>
```

## Usage

Once the script is loaded, you can add the new component to a page.

```html
<inline-outline>
  
</inline-outline>
```
